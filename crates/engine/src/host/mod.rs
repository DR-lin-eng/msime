//! The host facade: product glue of 水杉输入法 itself, the surface host-api and input-runtime call (api-contract.md), the one the removed C++ bridge used to expose. It holds the logic that lived in `bridge.cpp` rather than in the engine: the `EngineOptions` mapping with the product defaults and the translation sidecar, the flattened snapshot with the helpcode annotation rule and the nine-key and Microsoft mirrors, the host command numbering, the raw-commit learning policy and `CommitRawWithoutLearning`, and the session-free dictionary management, sync, gloss, catalog, `/`-mode table and text helpers the settings pages and providers use.
//!
//! Everything here is product glue: it exists for msime's own hosts, is not part of the documented library API (the core layer at the crate root) and may change with them. A type or function the core layer itself takes or returns, or that a third-party host needs to use a core option (the helpcode table, the `/`, `@` and K mode tables, custom shuangpin and nine-key shuangpin tables), lives at the crate root instead, and msime's hosts import it from there too.
//!
//! `host::Session` is a thin wrapper over the core [`crate::Session`]: the core owns the candidate revision, teardown, the key grid, the helpcode table and the shuangpin profile, and the wrapper only adds the product's contract on top. Errors are `EngineError`, whose `Display` is the C++ exception text; callers read it through `to_string()`. Audio capture lives in host-api, and offline handwriting recognition is `crate::handwriting`.
